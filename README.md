# Embedded Alarm Clock Application

This repository contains an embedded application that implements an alarm clock using an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module. The application is designed to run on an embedded system, such as a microcontroller, and provides basic alarm clock functionality.

## Features

The embedded alarm clock application offers the following features:

1. **Real-Time Clock**: The application utilizes an RTC module to keep track of the current date and time accurately.

2. **Alarm Setting**: Users can set the desired alarm time using the application's user interface. The alarm time can be set to any valid time within the range supported by the RTC module.

3. **Alarm Triggering**: When the current time matches the set alarm time, the application triggers an alarm. This can be in the form of a buzzer sound, flashing LEDs, or any other output mechanism supported by the embedded system.

4. **Alarm Snooze**: Users can snooze the alarm if they wish to be reminded again after a short period. The snooze duration can be configured within the application.

## Getting Started

To use the embedded alarm clock application, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the RTC module to the embedded system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure that the necessary power and communication connections are established.

2. **Software Configuration**: Modify the application's source code to match your hardware configuration. This may include specifying the communication interface, I2C address, or any other necessary parameters.

3. **Build and Flash**: Compile the application's source code using the appropriate toolchain and flash it onto the embedded system. Refer to the specific instructions provided by your development environment.

4. **Running the Application**: Power up the embedded system and observe the application running. Use the user interface provided by the application to set the desired alarm time.

5. **Testing the Alarm**: Wait for the alarm time to match the current time and observe the alarm triggering mechanism in action. Verify that the alarm is working correctly as per your hardware configuration.
